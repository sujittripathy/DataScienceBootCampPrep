--------- Given ----------

Person Suffering and result is +ve = 98%

Person is not Suffering and result is +ve = 10%

Population Sufferer is = 0.05%

---------- Derived ----------

1. 0.5% of having Th (99.5% doesn't have Th)

2. 98% gives pos result when Th is there (means 2% is miss)

3. 10% given postive when its not there (means 90% gives correct result)

Th (0.5% = 0.005)
No Th (99.95% = 0.9995)

Test Pos (having Th - true pos) - 0.05% * 98% = 0.00049

Test Pos (having no Th) - 10% * 99.95% = 0.0999

Test Neg (having Th) - 2% * 0.5% 

Test Neg (having no Th)


na| Th(0.5%)|No Th(99.5%)
---|---|---
Test pos |(0.005*0.98) = 0.0049|(0.995*0.1)=0.0995
Test Neg|0.0001|90% * 99.5% = 0.8955


1. Be Positive = 0.0049 + 0.0995 = 0.1044

2. Correctly diagnose a sufferer of Thripshaw's = 0.98 ~ 98%

3. Correctly identify a non-sufferer of Thripshaw's = 0.9 ~ 90% which is false negative

4. Misclassify the person - 0.0995 + 0.0001 = 0.0996 (Test po + No Th and Test Neg + Th)
