1. Data Source: Amsterdam availability data scraped from AirBnB on December 24th. 

Question: What are the popular neighborhoods in Amsterdam?

Answer: This data maybe biased becaused of the December 25th holiday bookings on the neighborhoods which are near by popular attractions so may give a false impression. The question can be asked in a different way that what are the most popular neighborhoods in Amsterdam at the time of Christmas which may solve the purpose of the scraped data. 

2. Data Source: Mental health services use on September 12, 2001 in San Francisco, CA and New York City, NY. 

Question: How do patterns of mental health service use vary between cities?

Answer: This pattern will vary much between San Francisco and New York City after the incident of September 11, 2001 which will have bias result to one city data set compare to other which mayn't calculate the pattern correctly. The question can be asked in a bit different way that how much mental health has been impacted in Ney York City after September 11, 2001 compare to earlier in the same city and compare to San Francisco.

3. Data Source: Armenian Pub Survey. 

Question: What are the most common reasons Armenians visit local pubs?

Answer - The most common reason shows 'Hang out with friends' which is more than 80% of the population. It seems the data sample population is biased to a specfic age group rather spreading out to multiple groups who goes to pub. The question can be modified by asking a specific age group (if the data is biased). For example - What are the most common reason American teen visit to local pubs?
