### 1. Calculate the probability of flipping a balanced coin four times and getting each pattern: HTTH, HHHH and TTHH.

HTTH - this pattern can occur once out of 16 events so, probability is 1/16 = 0.0625

HHHH - same as above. Can only occur once out of 16 events so, probability is 1/16 = 0.0625

TTHH - This pattern too can occur once so, probability is 1/16  = 0.0625
